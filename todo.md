For some reason, ImGUI does not render properly. Maybe we need to render something else as well?

- Try to render a triangle first, by adding attributes to the application class that contain our shaders.
    - Add buffers
        - Buffers are mostly complete. Need to add index buffers and organise application class better.
    - Add uniforms and textures.
